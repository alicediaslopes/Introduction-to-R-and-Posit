# R and RStudio

If you want to use R to analyse the data for your MSc dissertation, you will need to download and install R and RStudio on your own computer. This page  presents a brief introduction to R and RStudio and a step-by-step guide on how to download and install both.

**R** is an open-source, flexible and powerful language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It consists of a core which carries out standard statistical calculations, and a very large library of packages to do specialist functions - from amazing [data visualisations](r-graph-gallery.com/) to [apps](shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/)!

It also has a very friendly and supportive community of users. You can find countless free online courses, tutorials and forums that help people learn R. 
If you are completly new to coding, we suggest the Data Capentries' course ["R for Social Scientists"](https://preview.carpentries.org/r-socialsci/index.html). Still, it is important to remember that you will not become a coder - we are still Social Scientists! At the beginning of your R journey, google will be your best friend and you will copy and paste - or use [ChatGPT](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/12/chatgpt-can-create-datasets-program-in-r-and-when-it-makes-an-error-it-can-fix-that-too/) -  codes from online resources. 

The **R software** looks like those coding programmes from the 90s, in other words, it is not very user-friendly. If you decide to open R on your computer, you will get the following - scary - screen.

And that is why we need to install RStudio - unless you are [Angela Bennett](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113957/). 
**RStudio** is a cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) for the R statistical language, which is a user-friendly interface R. To function correctly, RStudio needs R and, therefore, both need to be installed on your computer. With RStudio, you will have the console, script, history, environment and plots in one window. You can see a screenshot from my current RStudio session below

To download and install R, go to https://cran.r-project.org/.
You need to select the version that matches your operating system (Linux, macOS or Windows).

To download and install RStudio, go to https://posit.co/downloads/

You will see that the link will direct you to the 'Posit' webpage. RStudio is currently being rebranded as 'Posit' even though users still refer to it as RStudio. The company wants to create a "language agnostic ecosystem" that will comprise R, Python and VS code.
