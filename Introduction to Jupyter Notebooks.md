## Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks 

<img src="Figures/Jupyter_logo.svg.png" align="left" alt="Jupyter Notebooks Logo" title="Jupyter Notebooks Logo" width="100" height="120"> To learn R in this course, we will use [Noteable](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/) which is a cloud-based application providing access to Jupyter Notebooks, developed and supported by the University of Edinburgh. 

Jupyter is a free, open-source, interactive web tool known as a computational notebook. With Jupyter Notebooks, we will be able to run R code, display outputs and graphs, and also add explanations in one document. “Jupyter” is a loose acronym meaning Julia, Python, and R. These programming languages were the first target languages of the Jupyter application, but nowadays, the notebook technology also supports many other languages.
